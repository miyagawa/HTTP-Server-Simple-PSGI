NAME
    HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI - PSGI handler for HTTP::Server::Simple

SYNOPSIS
        use HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI;

        my $server = HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI->new(
            host => $host,
            port => $port,
        );
        $server->run($app);

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI is a HTTP::Server::Simple based HTTP server
    that can run PSGI applications. This module only depends on
    HTTP::Server::Simple, which itself doesn't depend on any non-core
    modules except URI.pm, so it's best to be used as an embedded web
    server.
